# Homework

This should all be done in PHP using WP functions/hooks/classes/methods where applicable.

No JS is required.

## Back-end

1. Create a WP plugin that creates a Custom Post Type called "Thing".
2. Add two meta boxes to the CPT:
   1. A text field
   2. A checkbox

## Front-end

1. When browsing to `/thing/[post-slug]`, the post should display the contents of the text field if the checkbox is checked.
